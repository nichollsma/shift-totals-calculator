### Overview
 This is a simple student-developed program developed to help create an overview for the data of a restaurant server's shift.  
 This program will also assist in calculating an optional bar tipout, as well as the net tips earned after the tipout.  
 Users will select an option in the menu, which will be to either input data, calculate a bar tipout or net tips earned, and display an overview of shift data.  
 The menu is very easy to navigate and use, and only requires simple inputs from the user to operate.  

 Here are some images of the menu in action:
